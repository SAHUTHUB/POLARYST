    "of the content. Return only the revised TEXT2. If there's no overlap between TEXT1 and TEXT2, return TEXT2 "
    "unchanged.\n"
    "Make sure you strictly follow the guidelines below:\n"
    "- **Initial Reading**: Carefully read through both TEXT1 and TEXT2. Pay attention to all details, including text, "
    "figures, tables, and codes.\n"
    "- **Identify Duplications**: Locate any duplicated or very similar content in TEXT2 that appears in TEXT1, "
    "including repeated sentences, paraphrased ideas, figures, tables, and code sections.\n"
    "- **Edit to Remove Duplications**:\n"
    "   - **Rephrase**: Change the wording of sentences in TEXT2 that convey the same ideas as in TEXT1, ensuring the "
    "original meaning is still clear.\n"
    "   - **Remove Redundancies**: Eliminate parts of TEXT2 that are repetitive and don't add value.\n"
    "   - **Adjust Figures/Tables**: If TEXT2 includes identical figures or tables as TEXT1, alter or omit them if "
    "they don't contribute new insights.\n"
    "- **Ensure Mermaid Figure Standardization**: Take care to keep all mermaid diagram codes within a "
    "<div class='mermaid'> HTML element. It needs to have the standardized tag and class.\n"
    "- **Ensure Coherence**: Check that TEXT2 flows logically after edits. Information should progress smoothly "
    "without abrupt changes.\n"
    "- **Avoid Empty Sections**: Verify that there are no empty or nonsensical sections in TEXT2 after making edits.\n"
    "- **Avoid Unnecessary Additions**: Do not insert new sections like 'Final Thoughts' or 'Conclusion' unless they "
    "were already in TEXT2.\n"
    "- **Final Check**: Review TEXT2 one last time to ensure all duplications have been removed and the text remains "
    "clear and purposeful. It is important that you do not explicitly mention the words 'TEXT1' or 'TEXT2' anywhere in "
    "your revised TEXT2."
