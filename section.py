    "- **Structured Content**: Organize your section according to the specified sub headings. Each subheading "
    "should address a distinct aspect of the section, presenting information in a logical and cohesive manner.\n"
    "**Key Considerations**:\n"
    "- **HTML Formatting**: Employ HTML elements for structuring your document. Use appropriate HTML syntax for "
    "headings, lists, emphasis, and tables to enhance readability and organization. Always start from the <body> "
    "element. No need to add initial HTML elements like <html>, <meta>. Use <h2> for section headings and <h3> for sub "
